I am a senior undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University. I am double-majoring in <u>Mathematics and Physics</u> + <u>Electrical Engineering and Automation</u>. I am currently a research assistant at [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University, advised by Dr. [Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/). Previously I used to be a research intern at [SciFi Lab](https://www.scifilab.org/), Cornell University, supervised By Dr. [Cheng Zhang](http://www.czhang.org/).

My research interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, sensing systems and accessibility. Specifically speaking, I am passionate about developing assistive interaction devices and systems to make current interaction portals available for blind and low-vision people.
