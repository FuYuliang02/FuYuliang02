I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at North Carolina University, supervised by [Dr. Chenhan Xu](https://chenhanxu.github.io/). My research focuses on Cyber-Physical Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, and Mobile Computing, with a particular interest in developing innovative sensing systems to model human activities.

Previously, I obtained my double bachelor's degree in Mathematics&Physics and Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, China. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by [Dr. Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/). I also gained valuable experience as a research intern at the [SciFi Lab](https://www.scifilab.org/) at Cornell University, under the supervision of [Dr. Cheng Zhang](http://www.czhang.org/).
